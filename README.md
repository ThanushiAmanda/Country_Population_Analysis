# Comparative Population Analysis Project

## âœ¨ **Overview**

This project is designed to analyze **population growth trends** and **compare the populations** of selected **European countries** over time. The project utilizes **Python**, **Pandas**, and **Matplotlib** to process data and generate visualizations that compare population growth trends in a meaningful way.

### **Key Features**:
- Analyzes population growth for selected **European countries**.
- Data is processed using **Pandas** for efficient data handling and filtering.
- Custom visualizations created using **Matplotlib** for clear and informative graphs.
- Population growth is **normalized** to show changes relative to the year.

## ðŸ’» **Technologies Used**:
- **Python**: The main programming language used for this project.
- **Pandas**: A powerful data manipulation library for handling datasets efficiently.
- **Matplotlib**: A widely used library for generating static, animated, and interactive plots.
